	-- Everything past this line uses the new "AutoSay" function, which automates the process and no longer needs to modify code
	-- You may freely modify everything above, but you CANNOT add new lines (for now)
	-- Everything below is modifiable, and can have new lines
	-- Modifying the above lines to work with the new system would be just time consuming, that said I might modify it in the future but don't expect it guaranteed
	-- If you want to add new lines, follow the numerical values
	-- If you want to add sequences, start by writing down the number, and then _1 at the end
	-- I'll use the following line as an example: UI_DM_something
	-- Correct example: UI_DM_something1, UI_DM_something1_1
	-- Incorrect example: UI_DM_something1_1, UI_DM_something1_2
	-- Adding new traits and occupations directly is implemented, they will always take priority over the default line, default lines will never be spoken
	-- Occupations and traits must be written like how they're used in the code; for example, Amateur Mechanic would be "Mechanics2"
	-- Occupations are checked first, traits are checked in the order of the traits, aka random
	-- How to add occupations/traits: Simply write the code name for the occupation/trait right before the number, then follow it up with _ and do the numbers (the _ is there to allow for numbers in traits/occupations)
	-- I'll give the following examples
	-- UI_DM_somethingOccupationName_1 = "i occupy my occupation",
	-- UI_DM_somethingTraitName_1 = "i have a trait",
	
	-- If you want to check for BOTH occupations and a trait:
	-- First, write down the following line, text can be anything (including empty), BUT IT MUST EXIST
	-- UI_DM_somethingOccupationName_1 = "",
	-- Then, replace the 1 with trait name, and add _1 at the end
	-- UI_DM_somethingOccupationName_TraitName_1 = "wow i am occupant of my occupation and i have the trait",
	-- UI_DM_somethingOccupationName_TraitName_1_1 = "follow up message",
	
	-- If you want to check for multiple traits:
	-- UI_DM_somethingFirstTraitName_SecondTraitName_1 = "wow i have both traits!",
	-- Please note for this to work, UI_DM_somethingFirstTraitName_1 must exist, it can be empty.
	
	-- If you want to check for an occupation and multiple traits:
	-- UI_DM_somethingOccupationName_FirstTraitName_SecondTraitName_1 = "wow im occupying my occupation and i have two traits coolio",
	-- Please note for this to work, UI_DM_somethingOccupationName_1 must exist, and UI_DM_somethingOccupationName_FirstTraitName_1 must also exist, it can be empty.
	-- Empty lines will be ignored for the purposes of speech
	-- For example, if you have UI_DM_somethingOccupationName1 = "" and UI_DM_somethingOccupationName_TraitName_1 = "message"
	-- then it'll say UI_DM_somethingOccupationName_TraitName_1 if you have both the occupation and trait
	-- and it'll say UI_DM_something if you don't have both
	
	-- If you want to add a specific character name interaction, write down their name LOWERCASE
	-- UI_DM_something_charactername_1
	-- This supports forenames, surnames and full names automatically
